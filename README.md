# :earth_americas: Clustering countries using PCA
![Alt text](Countries.jpg)


### :newspaper: overview
---
In this project, I want to implement some clustering algorithms with a dimensionality reduction method on Country Data, which includes countries data like socio, economic and health factors.

After, preprocessing and EDA sections I used a dimensionality reduction method which is principal component analysis (PCA) and then I used 3 clustering algorithms such as K-Means, MiniBatchKMeans and Birch to cluster countries for HELP International.

HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

So the purpose is to classify countries and find countries which need more aid.


### :black_nib: Dataset Description

**Objective:**
To categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.

**About organization:**
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

**Problem Statement:**
HELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. So, CEO has to make decision to choose the countries that are in the direst need of aid. Hence, your Job as a Data scientist is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.
